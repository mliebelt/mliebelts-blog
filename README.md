# mliebelts starter blog

This is my second try to have a starter blog on gh-pages. This time I try to use Gatsby.js for that task.

## Visiting the site

After deployment, the site should be visible under [https://mliebelt.github.io](https://mliebelt.github.io).

## Further steps

* Add from here to there additional content.
* Find ways to mix different things here (like blog articles made in pure HTML, mix of HAML, SASS, ...)
