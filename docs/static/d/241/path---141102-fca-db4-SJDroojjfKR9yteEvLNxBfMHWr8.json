I heard about it in the Ruby Rogues session\n<a href=\"http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/171-rr-evaluating-yourself\">Evaluating Yourself</a>\nand decided: I have to have this book. I have read in it here or there,\nand decided to try it out with this new blog thing I am doing now.</p>\n<p>And what should I say? It works great for me. I have not done all of it,\nhave to split my styles, but alone the explanation when to use classes\nor IDs in CSS, how to name then, and how to organize them has helped me a lot.</p>\n<p>So the need to use SAAs will be much lower, because following the rules\nis pretty simple most of the time. Let’s see if it scales over time, so\nif the rules are easier manageable than before.</p>\n<p>Try it out, and please: buy it! It is worth every cent!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scalble and Modular Arachitecture for CSS","author":"Jonathan Snook","date":"02. 11. 2014","tags":["css","web"],"isbn":"978-0985632106","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/smacss-d9c6a969eb50c8c158cfe36eabf62536.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/141102/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/141101/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Die Haarteppichknüpfer","path":"/141101","tags":["fantasy"],"posttype":"book","author":"Amdreas Eschbach"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/141107/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Imagery","path":"/141107","tags":["roman"],"posttype":"book","author":"Christoph Marzi"}}}}
