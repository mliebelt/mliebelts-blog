There are of course\nnumerous sources that explain that in greater detail. Perhaps this description\nwill help someone in a similar situation as I am.</p>\n<h1>Setup</h1>\n<p>The documentation site <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home\">http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home</a>\nis exactly what you want to use.\nFor me, the following steps were sufficient:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Ruby (and DevKit for Ruby).</li>\n<li>Install Jekyll by <code class=\"language-text\">gem install jekyll</code></li>\n<li>Clone your repository from GitHub, in my case <a href=\"https://github.com/mliebelt/mliebelt.github.io\">https://github.com/mliebelt/mliebelt.github.io</a></li>\n<li>I use the Git Bash as the shell, and start there in the cloned directory <code class=\"language-text\">jekyll serve</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When I look now at <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:4000</code>, I see</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Forbidden\nno access permission to `/&#39;\nWEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/1.9.3/2014-02-24) at localhost:4000</code></pre></div>\n<p>I am now able to serve my first page, the <code class=\"language-text\">index.html</code> page that I have included in the root directory.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"lesson\"><p>Lesson 1: You are able to serve any HTML page when you use the default configuration of Jekyll. The HTML files\n    (and the necessary JavaScript and CSS files) are copied to the directory `_site` and served from there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then I worked on the HTML file and the styles, and the page was recreated in the background again and again.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"lesson\"><p>Lesson 2: When you serve your content locally with Jekyll, it is watched and regenerated on every change.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I then looked if I need the configuration file <code class=\"language-text\">_config.yml</code>, and created it, but did not find anything I wanted\nto change compared to the defaults. The defaults are nicely documented in <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/\">http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/</a>,\nsection “Front Matter defaults”.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"lesson\"><p>Lesson 3: Jekyll works fine only with defaults and conventions. You are able to add what you need on demand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And mostly without even stopping the server.</p>\n<h2>Directory Layout</h2>\n<p>I then read further, and found that it would be best to start only with drafts first. So I created a directory\n<code class=\"language-text\">_drafts</code>, and added there my first blog post (named as file <code class=\"language-text\">2014-10-10-jekyll-first-steps.md</code>) - namely this file.</p>\n<p>I had then to start the server anew, and add there the flag <code class=\"language-text\">--drafts</code>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"lesson\"><p>Lesson 4: When working with drafts use as command <code>jekyll serve --drafts</code>.\n Your files are then located as usually, in the target directory <code>_site/&lt;year>/&lt;month>/&lt;day>/&lt;filename>.html</code> .</p></blockquote>\n<p>To publish posts, you should add as well a directory <code class=\"language-text\">_posts</code> for them.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"lesson\"><p>Lesson 5: To publish a blog post, you just have to move the file from directory <code>_drafts</code>\n to the directory <code>_posts</code>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let’s try it, and start the server then without the flag <code class=\"language-text\">--drafts</code>. You see now the file served as usual. I have tried\nthat with a file <code class=\"language-text\">2014-10-10-dummy.md</code>, which was served then as <code class=\"language-text\">2014/10/10/dummy.html</code>.</p>\n<p>This is different from the format used for the draft blog posts. There the result is: <code class=\"language-text\">2014/10/10/2014-10-10-dummy.html</code>. Mmmmh, no idea what to do here.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Let’s stop here and repeat later with another blog to the topics that will come naturally when you want to blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I think the following will be of interest for people with a similar background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typical directory layout and consequences</li>\n<li>Working with drafts and publishing</li>\n<li>Rendering options, layout, constraints</li>\n<li>Working with different topics, tags, …</li>\n<li>How to structure a blog web site (more or less) automatically</li>\n<li>What are possible extensions: how to blog with e.g. HAML (instead of Markdown)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s see if that story will work in such a way … :-)</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Problems ro remember</h1>\n<h2>Problems with the front-loading</h2>\n<p>From time to time, I stumble over things like …</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Regenerating: 1 files at 2014-10-10 23:44:39\nYAML Exception reading .../mliebelt.github.io/_drafts/2014-10-10-jekyll-first-steps.md:\n(&lt;unknown&gt;): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3</code></pre></div>\n<p>What?!?
